      In this discussion, we’ll discuss how nearly every retail and
      wholesale business is jumping aboard the direct-to-consumer (D2C)
      bandwagon after stay-at-home orders kept stores closed. Many
      natively D2C brands have thrived through the business
      interruption, and traditional wholesale brands are accelerating
      their plans to adopt this business model. If it wasn’t already
      apparent that this shift was here to stay, it surely is now. The
      speakers will discuss: The impact COVID-19 has had on sales and
      business operations; how Thompson Tee has weathered interruptions
      to their businesses; adjustments Thompson Tee made to their
      business processes, financial management and business strategies;
      and specific plans Thompson Tee put in place as economic activity
      begins to bounce back
